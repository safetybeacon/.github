# Safety Beacon üö®

## The concept üí°

You've probably heard of the "angel shot", where somebody can ask at the bar for an "angel shot" if they feel unsafe on a date so the staff can (subtly) make sure they can get out/home safely.

I'm imagining a similar thing in digital form.

You sign up (requiring ID check), and then you're able to send out a "help me" notification to everyone who also has this app within a ~300m radius so they can step in to help and/or call the police.

## The plan ü•∑

I'd like it to be non-for-profit and fully open source, so it's about everyone helping everyone, for the sake of keeping each other safe.
